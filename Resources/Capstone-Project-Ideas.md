## Project Selection Criteria

### Choose a project that:
1. **Solves a real problem** (even if simple)
2. **Fits the 3-day timeline** (MVP scope)
3. **Demonstrates key concepts**:
   - CRUD operations
   - Authentication
   - Database relationships
   - API design
   - Frontend-backend integration
4. **Allows AI tool usage** across SDLC phases
5. **Is personally interesting** to you

### Avoid projects that:
- Are too complex for 3 days
- Require external APIs (unless simple)
- Need real-time features (unless you have experience)
- Require complex algorithms
- Need mobile apps (unless web-first)

## Project Planning Tips

1. **Start with MVP**: Identify core features that make the app functional
2. **Prioritize features**: Must-have vs. nice-to-have
3. **Use AI for scaffolding**: Generate initial structure with AI
4. **Iterate quickly**: Get something working, then enhance
5. **Document as you go**: Use AI to generate documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your project** from the list above
2. **Define MVP scope** - what's the minimum viable product?
3. **Create PRD** using the PRD template
4. **Design architecture** using AI assistance
5. **Start building** with AI pair programming

Good luck! 🚀
