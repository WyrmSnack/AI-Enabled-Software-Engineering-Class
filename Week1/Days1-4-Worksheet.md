## Pre-Activity: Understanding the Assessment Process

**Why assessments matter**:
- They establish your baseline knowledge
- They help identify areas where you might need extra support
- They ensure you're ready for the hands-on work ahead
- They provide data to track your progress

**Approach**:
- Take your time—these aren't timed tests
- Be honest about your current knowledge
- Use them as learning opportunities
- Don't stress—this is about readiness, not perfection
