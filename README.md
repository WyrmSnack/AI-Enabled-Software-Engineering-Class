## Course Overview

A 3-week, hands-on program (preceded by a self-paced Week 0 foundation) that teaches software engineers how to apply large language models (LLMs) and developer AI tools across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- **Explain fundamentals** of large language models and effective prompting techniques
- **Identify key integration points** of GenAI across the SDLC
- **Use LLMs and GenAI tools** for requirements, design, code generation, and testing
- **Apply prompt engineering** tailored to different SDLC phases
- **Integrate GitHub Copilot** into development environments to improve speed and accuracy
- **Build and present** a working prototype demonstrating GenAI‑enhanced workflows

## Course Structure

- **Week 0**: Self-Paced Prep (5-7 days, 1-2 hours/day)
- **Week 1**: Assessment & Selection (5 days)
- **Week 2**: SDLC with GenAI (5 days)
- **Week 3**: Advanced Topics & Capstone (5 days)
