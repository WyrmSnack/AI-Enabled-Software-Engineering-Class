# Day 0.1 Worksheet: Orientation — How the SDLC Works

**Estimated Time**: 1–2 hours  
**Focus**: Understanding the Software Development Lifecycle and how GenAI fits in

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Explain what the SDLC is and why it matters
- Identify the main phases of software development
- Understand how GenAI can accelerate each SDLC phase
- Reflect on your own learning preferences and readiness

## Pre-Activity: Self-Assessment

Before diving in, take a moment to reflect:

1. **What experience do you have with software development?**
   - [ ] None — this is my first exposure
   - [ ] Some — I've written code but not in a team setting
   - [ ] Moderate — I've worked on small projects
   - [ ] Experienced — I've worked on production software

2. **What do you hope to gain from this course?**
   - Write 2–3 sentences:

   _______________________________________________________________________
   _______________________________________________________________________
   _______________________________________________________________________

## Activity 1: Watch "What is the SDLC?"

**Resource**: Search YouTube for "What is the SDLC?" by freeCodeCamp (≈10 minutes)

**While watching, take notes on**:
- The main phases mentioned
- How each phase connects to the next
- Any tools or practices mentioned

**Notes**:

## Activity 2: Read Microsoft Learn SDLC Overview

**Resource**: [Microsoft Learn – SDLC Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/what-is-sdlc)

**Key concepts to identify**:
1. **Planning/Requirements**: What problem are we solving?
2. **Design/Architecture**: How will we solve it?
3. **Development/Coding**: Building the solution
4. **Testing**: Ensuring it works correctly
5. **Deployment**: Making it available to users
6. **Maintenance**: Keeping it running and improving it

**Fill in the table below**:

| SDLC Phase | What Happens Here | Example Activities | How GenAI Could Help |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Planning/Requirements | | | |
| Design/Architecture | | | |
| Development/Coding | | | |
| Testing | | | |
| Deployment | | | |
| Maintenance | | | |

## Activity 3: GenAI Across the SDLC

Think about how AI tools could assist in each phase. For each phase, write one way GenAI could help:

**Planning/Requirements**:

## Activity 4: Reflection

**Prompt**: "Which SDLC phase feels most natural to you and why?"

**Instructions**: Write a 1-page reflection (approximately 250–300 words) addressing:
- Which phase resonates with you most
- Why that phase appeals to you
- What concerns or questions you have about other phases
- How you think GenAI might help you in your preferred phase

**Your Reflection**:
